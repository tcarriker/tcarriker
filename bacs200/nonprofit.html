                    <h2>Social Media Stokes Extremes</h2>
                    <p>Social media can show us the best of us all or the worst of us all there is very little inbetween. Unfortunately, social media makes us hate one side or another more than we should ever hate someone, especially just for their beliefs. Not only does it make us politically extreme, but it also makes us view ourselves in extreme fashion as well. We need to avoid this by logging off and remembering we are all human beings who need a break. </p>

                    <h2>Why We need freedom to ring</h2>
                    <p>Freedom, it's supposed to be our most sacred value in this country, but is it really? It's hard to say yes from my point of view. With mass protests and racial tensions high, how free are we? I mean we can't even legally collect rainwater. 
                    To get back to the principals of the founding of this nation we need to reevaluate how free we are and how free we want to be and then decide if we want to shake thses chains.</p>
