        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always willing to do the right thing</li>
        <li>Not afraid of the personalconsequences</li>
        <li>Not afraid</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & commitment - his sacrifice cost him a normal life</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>
        Not many of this man, but he risked it all to blow the whistle on major transgressions by the federal government, and their wire trapping of US citizens.
        He was forced out of the country and in hiding away from the US. While many people would call him a traitor I believe him to be a true patriot for
        his service and revelations which have recently been considered unconstituional by a federal court. He risked a normal life to share the truth and for that I am 
        greatful!
