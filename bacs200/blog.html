                    <h2>Social Media Stokes Extremes</h2>
                    <p>Social media can show us the best of us all or the worst of us all there is very little inbetween. Unfortunately, social media makes us hate one side or another more than we should ever hate someone, especially just for their beliefs. Not only does it make us politically extreme, but it also makes us view ourselves in extreme fashion as well. We need to avoid this by logging off and remembering we are all human beings who need a break. </p>
