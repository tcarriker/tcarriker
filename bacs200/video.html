        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
             Social media can show us the best of us all or the worst of us all there is very little inbetween. Unfortunately, social media makes us hate one side or another more than we should ever hate someone, especially just for their beliefs. Not only does it make us politically extreme, but it also makes us view ourselves in extreme fashion as well. We need to avoid this by logging off and remembering we are all human beings who need a break.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pt-2 rounded mb-0">
          Freedom, it's supposed to be our most sacred value in this country, but is it really? It's hard to say yes from my point of view. With mass protests and racial tensions high, how free are we? I mean we can't even legally collect rainwater. To get back to the principals of the founding of this nation we need to reevaluate how free we are and how free we want to be and then decide if we want to shake thses chains.

        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
            Free speech is critical but balancing free speech with the need to defeat misinformation and remaning informed is critical as well. While this can be a difficult  balance to strike if everyone commits to being informed then we can do it!

                                I am a stronfg proponent of free speech so regulating what can be said on social media is not ideal for me. That is why we all need to do our part by staying up to date and researching before posting!

                                <span class="text-danger">How We Can do This:</span>
                               When you see some very sensationalist post on social media that pushes your point if view heavily, first you should research other relevant sources to insure what you are posting is true.
                                Of course you should also verify that your source is reliable and not some heavily biased proganda.
                                 And third you should see if you can find articles on the subject written by someone with an opposing view to yours and see if there is any middle ground.

                                Regulating free speech is not our job but making sure you aren't spreading the fire of misinformation is!
